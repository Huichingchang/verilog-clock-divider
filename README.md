# ⏱️ Verilog Clock Divider

This project implements a **clock divider** in Verilog. It divides the input clock frequency by a specified value, creating a slower output clock. Clock dividers are essential in digital systems to generate slower clocks from high-frequency ones.

## 🔁 Clock Divider Behavior

- Divides input clock frequency by **a power of 2** (e.g. divide-by-4)
- Uses a counter that toggles the output when half the period is reached

Example: If clk is 100MHz and you divide by 4, clk_out becomes 25MHz.

## 📷 Waveform

Captured in **ModelSim**, this waveform shows:

- Input clock `clk`
- Reset `rst`
- Output clock `clk_out` toggles after a fixed number of input clock cycles
